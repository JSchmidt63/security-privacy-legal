# draw.io for Trello Security and Privacy

This readme describes the security and privacy details of the official [draw.io Trello integration](https://trello.com/power-ups/59e60179a83e5a5354c68bec/draw-io-diagrams).

### Privacy

No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected by the power-up.

### Security and data flow

The draw.io application is served from the production draw.io servers, see the generic draw.io security policies.

No data is stored in draw.io servers, all diagram data are stored as attachments to the Trello cards.

No diagram data is sent to draw.io servers, with the exception of the generation of the image preview when using Internet Explorer 11. All modern browsers generate the preview image on the client and no data is transferred to draw.io servers.
