### DPA (Data Processing Agreement/Addendum)

A common request is for us to provide a copy of our data processing agreement. Under GDPR a data processor is an entity that processes personal data on behalf of a data controller (likely your company/organization). We do not process any data that we define as personal. That includes names, emails, country, language, etc. For this reason, we state that we are not a data processor for users of draw.io.

If you contact us, you are directly to the DPA of the platform you use to contact us with. Please read their DPA and ensure you restrictly PII to a minimal when using the platform(s) to contact us.

* Helpdesk at desk.draw.io : [Freskdesk DPA](https://www.freshworks.com/data-processing-addendum/) (note that an email to support@draw.io is directed to freskdesk.) We do not like the broad scope of the Freskdesk DPA overly, if you wish to file a support email without * going through Freskdesk, email support@jgraph.com (paying users only).
