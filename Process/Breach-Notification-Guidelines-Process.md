### Background Information

draw.io is an open source technology stack for building diagramming applications, and the world’s most widely used browser-based end-user diagramming application, diagrams.net.
The aim is to provide free, high quality diagramming software for everyone.

### Purpose

This guideline and process document defines the procedures and steps required for identifying, handling, managing and reporting breaches of JGraph Ltd systems and assets, including data and information assets, personally identifiable information, services and resources, and third parties in alignment with legislative, contractual, and regulatory requirements.

### Scope

This policy applies to all personnel, including contractors, of JGraph Ltd and all activities relating to the use, handling, management or control of information assets and systems controlled by JGraph Ltd.

### Breach Guidelines

Breaches of JGraph Ltd are not limited to disclosure of sensitive information, but can be a result of compromise of systems, third party or service provider compromise. The following headings detail the various breach types, what they encompass and how they may occur.

A storage device refers to any item that can store data, such as laptops, USB drive, and external HDD.


#### Information Breach

A breach of information refers to any type of loss, destruction or theft of information or data held by JGraph Ltd and indirectly held by any third party entrusted with JGraph Ltd customers.

##### Loss or Leakage

Loss of information or data is when it is unknown how, who, or where the information may have been disclosed. Misplacing a storage device with JGraph Ltd data on it and being unable to recover the physical device or verify the chain of custody upon recovery is considered a loss event.

Verifying the chain of custody upon recovery of the storage device helps validate that the storage device was not accessed and a copy of the data made.

Malicious intent can also relate to data loss, the information is not specifically stolen but purposely transferred to another entity without authorisation from JGraph Ltd, such as a personal Google Drive account, Dropbox, Owncloud or Pastebin.


##### Destruction

Destruction is where the data has been deleted or destroyed purposely or accidentally and may be recovered or lost permanently. Such an event could be the irreversible destruction of information assets, such as physical destruction of all storage media holding the data, organisation wide cryptolocker infection or simply deleting the data and all of its backups.

##### Theft

Theft of information assets is akin to loss or leakage but implies a purposeful malicious intent, identifying that JGraph Ltd was targeted by a malicious actor in order to obtain non-public information about JGraph Ltd and its customers.

This is as likely to be performed by an internal party as it is an external party in most organisations. However, with the size of JGraph Ltd as of May 2018, it is understood that theft of information assets is more likely to occur by an external party targeting JGraph Ltd.

#### Systems Breach

A systems breach is where JGraph Ltd systems, such as their laptops, are directly compromised by malicious code or a malicious actor, regardless of intent.

JGraph Ltd does not maintain its own infrastructure and instead relies upon SaaS solutions as provided by Google to deliver their platform. As such, the only systems breach would be directly impacting their workstations or be considered a third party breach.

In the event of a systems breach, it is imperative to determine the purpose of the malicious actor or malicious code, primarily to validate if information assets theft was intended.

#### Third party breach

Third party breach is where a supplier to JGraph Ltd is breached themselves. Identification of such a breach relies heavily on the third party reporting the breach to its customers or the breach itself being made public.

It is recommended to develop a strong relationship with suppliers, where possible, to help ensure you are notified in the event of a potential breach.

Where a third party breach has occurred and JGraph Ltd has been identified, JGraph Ltd must identify the scope of the breach and the data directly related to JGraph Ltd that was impacted.

### Breach Notification Plan

There are no prescriptive guidelines for breach notifications in the United Kingdom. However, as customers may reside within the EU, the requirements as defined by the GDPR are generally applicable (any resident within the EU).

Where it is considered that data of a subject within the EU has been breached, mandatory disclosure to the ICO should be considered. Therefore, this document aims to be guidance for breach notifications as required by the GDPR.

#### Identifying a Breach

A breach is identified as any loss of integrity or compromise of security that has a significant impact on services provided or the personal data held by the processor or controller.

Identification of a breach can occur via automated or manual means, including being notified via a third party or external source.

#### Escalation Procedures

All suspected and actual breaches must be escalated to the owners of JGraph Ltd.

#### External Experts

JGraph Ltd will maintain a list of cyber security experts to utilise in the event of a breach. These experts should consist of:

- Independent third parties
- Federal agencies
- Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)

#### Identifying Remedial Actions

Engagement with independent third parties is to provide JGraph Ltd with a root cause analysis and mitigating controls to prevent the breach from occuring again.

#### Notifications

Notifications of breaches of personally identifiable information must be communicated to the ICO. Where there may be significant damage or danger to the persons leaked information, they too must be notified.

#### Involving Law Enforcement

Involvement of law enforcement - federal agencies - is only required where it is expected to identify and prosecute the responsible parties.

#### Third Party Engagement

Where JGraph Ltd does not maintain the capacity to validate or verify the claims of a breach, they should engage with a third party to review and assess the claim, systems involved, and other impacted third parties.

#### Breach Register

All suspected and actual breaches must be recorded in the Breach Register.

#### Lessons Learned and Post Breach Review

Once all legal requirements have been handled in respect to a breach (notifications to ICO) it is required to perform a lessons learned activity. This will allow JGraph Ltd to recognise how and why the breach occurred and to identify appropriate controls to limit identical breaches from occurring again.

### Breach Response Steps

The following four steps highlight what should be performed immediately upon notification of a suspected breach.

- Identify the impacted systems, isolate and contain them.
  - Ensure continued operation of security controls.
- Identify and verify the data suspected to be leaked and determine potential harm to individuals.
- Notify the ICO and individuals where applicable within 72 hours.
- Review the incident, implement remedial actions and conduct lessons learned.
