# draw.io Security, privacy and License texts

The repository contains version controlled master copies of security and privacy policies, as well as End User License Agreement (EULA) texts. The purposes of being version controlled is for you to be able to determine what policies and licenses applied on a specific date.

### Security

Also, under the security section is a security questionnarie based on reviews sent to us for draw.io. Since draw.io (aside from the Atlassian ecosystem) is an open source, zero cost SaaS tool, filling in individual security reviews does not scale. Many of you will say "Yes, I read that, but could you just fill in this one, please?". The answer will be no. You are welcome to suggest improvements to this public documentation.

### Change process

If you would like a change to a policy or license, or wish specific questions to be asked in the security FAQ, please submit an issue. Apply common sense for asking for changes to text relating to zero cost, open source tool. Submitting your company's standard EULA and asking to change the whole license to match it will be closed without reply. Change requests must be limited to improvements to the public content in this repository. We will not sign custom EULAs, fill in your security review or GDPR questionnarie. There are commercial companies/tools that will provide with a service that includes such Enterprises features as a paid service.

If your request relates to a paid product within the Atlassian ecosystem, you can either submit an issue on this project, or email support@draw.io. You are free to propose any changes, but smaller, well explained additions and changes are more likely to be taken for review.
